This repository tracks ongoing work about replacing OCaml's instrumented runtime with a tracing system, inspired by OCaml multicore's tracing system.

## How tracing works

The tracing runtime works by dispatching events to a buffer and flushing these periodically.
Within the runtime code, various functions are available to start recording events, attached with a timestamp sourced from a monotonic clock where each tick is a nanosecond that passed.

Once the event buffer is full, events will be serialized and pushed onto a file.

Tracing should be pause-able, stoppable and restartable, as well as streamable.


## Implementations

We currently have two different approaches to tracing implemented.
One is based on a simple port of OCaml multicore's tracing system, and the other one is making use of the CTF format.

Both can be tried easily, by compiling the following branches and running your compiled program with the following env variable:
`OCAML_EVENTLOG_ENABLED=1` and `OCAML_EVENTLOG_FILE=outputfile`.

Refer to the following sections for more information on where to find the implementation and how to read the generated files.

### Catapult/Chrome

OCaml multicore make use of Chrome's catapult, a tracer available in-browser recording and displaying traces informations.
The viewer can load its own format, written in either Json or Linux's ftrace format.
It has been ported to OCaml trunk and made to match what the instrumented runtime used to collect.

Sample trace for the trunk port can be found in `sample_traces` subdirectories, every `.json` file is a `catapult` file, you can open it through Chrome at `chrome://tracing`.

### Common Trace Format

Common Trace Format is a fast, binary and streamable format.

It is meant as a generalistic trace format, allowing reuse of existing tooling (like [babeltrace](https://diamon.org/babeltrace/) or [Trace Compass](https://www.eclipse.org/tracecompass/). `babeltrace` also enable painless conversion from one trace format to the other, providing a simple CTF reader.

[Tracing implemented with CTF output on OCaml trunk](https://github.com/Engil/ocaml/blob/ctf/runtime/eventlog.c)

Note that to read the file you should as well provide the `metadata` file on this repository, describing the CTF schema used by OCaml. (at the moment this file isn't generated by OCaml itself.)

See `scripts/ctf_to_catapult.py` to convert an OCaml CTF trace to Chrome's catapult format.

You can as well read the traces with `babeltrace` (available in most Linux distributions):

### CTF playground and performance report

You can consult here two notebooks.
`ctf.ipynb` contains a notebook showcasing how to interact with `4.10.0+ctf`'s CTF logs.
`perf_report.ipynb` contains a notebook with performance investigations on the cost of tracing within the OCaml runtime in our implementation.

Clicking on these files on Github should open an HTML view of the notebooks.
You can as well open the PDF version available in the repository.

To interact with the notebooks using jupyter:
```shell
$ cd docker
$ sudo docker build -t sandmark .
$ cd ..
$ docker run -v `pwd`:/analyze -p 8888:8888 -it sandmark
$ jupyter notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --allow-root
```
